# workshop_shiny_spring_2023

This repository contains slides and code for the CDVS spring 2023 workshop on dashboards.

A special thanks to Hadley Wickham for his [subset of the 2017 NEISS data](https://github.com/hadley/neiss). Also a special thanks to Mine Cetinkaya Rundell and Garrett Grolemund for inspiration (and few slides from RStudio) from their previous workshops on shiny.
